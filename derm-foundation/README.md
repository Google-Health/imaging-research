# Dermatology Foundation

**Derm Foundation** is a tool to generate embeddings from images of dermatology conditions. These embeddings can be used to develop custom machine learning models for dermatology use-cases with less data and compute.

Future updates to this document will include:

* How to sign up for API access
* Set up steps for API usage
* Links to a demo colab
* Model card
* Email contact for support questions

## General notes

* Google does not keep a copy of any images sent.
* Google monitors daily query volume and aggregates on a per-user and per-organization basis. Access can be revoked if a user or organization exceeds a reasonable query volume.
